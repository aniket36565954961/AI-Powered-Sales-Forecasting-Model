# AI-Powered-Sales-Forecasting-Model

# 📈 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data science solution designed to predict future sales trends using historical retail data. By leveraging machine learning techniques like **Time Series Forecasting** and **Regression**, this dashboard helps businesses identify seasonal patterns, optimize inventory, and make data-driven decisions.

The project demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment and visualization.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Time Series Forecasting:** Implements **Facebook Prophet** and **Scikit-learn** to generate accurate future sales predictions.
* **Trend & Seasonality Analysis:** Decomposes data to identify daily, weekly, and monthly sales patterns.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Visualizes historical vs. predicted data using **Matplotlib** and **Power BI**.
* **Data Processing:** robust handling of retail datasets using **Pandas** for cleaning and transformation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Facebook Prophet, Scikit-learn
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses retail sales data (daily/weekly/monthly) containing fields such as:
* `Date`: The timestamp of the sale.
* `Sales`: The total revenue or quantity sold.
* *(Add other specific columns here if your dataset has them, e.g., Store_ID, Category)*

## 📊 Results
The model outputs a visual forecast showing:
1.  **Predicted Trend:** The likely direction of future sales.
2.  **Uncertainty Intervals:** The range of possible outcomes.
3.  **Seasonality Components:** How holidays and weekends impact sales.
